# nummethod_flash_distillation
This is a final project from 2018 for Numerical Analysis for ChemE course. 

The goal of the porject is to apply our knowledge in implementing RK4, Newton-Raphson, gradient descent, Euler, and Cranks-Nicholson 
in a chemical engineering application, in this case a flash distillation. The code was implemented on MATLAB and a documentation is attached
to explain how the codes work.
